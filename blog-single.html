              <p>A film about finance! Who‚Äôs going to watch that?
                The financial problems , and finance in general, aren‚Äôt the usual fare of blockbuster movies. You‚Äôll probably never see The Rock playing in the movie . But in recent years, cinema has provided a useful window into a world that remains mysterious to many, despite the effect it has on all our lives..</p>
              <p>

              </p>
              <p>The Big Short is a 2015 American biographical comedy-drama film directed by Adam McKay. Written by McKay and Charles Randolph, it is based on the 2010 book The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine by Michael Lewis showing how the financial crisis of 2007‚Äì2008 was triggered by the United States housing bubble . The film stars Christian Bale, Steve Carell, Ryan Gosling and Brad Pitt, with Melissa Leo, Hamish Linklater, John Magaro, Rafe Spall, Jeremy Strong, Finn Wittrock, and Marisa Tomei in supporting roles.</p>
              <p>The Big Short was written by financial journalist Michael Lewis. His previous book Moneyball: The Art of Winning an Unfair Game, which was apparently about baseball statistics, also starring Brad Pitt, was nominated for six Oscars and took over $100m at the box office, proving that stats can make for compelling drama.</p>
              <p>Michael Lewis was a bond salesman on Wall Street before he became a writer, and his insight and experience enabled him to pen one of the most essential accounts of the 2007-2010 financial problems , called The Big Short: Inside the Doomsday Machine. First published in 2010, the book tells the story of the mounting problems in the US housing and mortgage markets that preceded the crash, and the select few people who not only saw it coming, but managed to turn that prediction into big profits for themselves.</p>
              <p>Essentially, they bet that the US housing market would crash, using a process known as ‚Äòshorting‚Äô. By doin.g this investors can make money out of products losing value, as well as gaining value, and successes can be made from the failure of others.
                Most of us when buying a house take out a loan (mortgage) and pay back the purchase price over time. We also usually hope that the value of the house we buy will go up not down. In the US, many people had come to assume that house prices would always rise, because they‚Äôd risen without fail for many years. This attitude saw mortgage lenders offering riskier and riskier loans to people who‚Äôd only be able to make payments if the price of their house continued to increase.<h3 class="heading"><a href="https://link.medium.com/s9UdVaIDo6">Read More</a></h3></p>
